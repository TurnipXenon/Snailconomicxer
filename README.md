<h1>Known bugs</h1>
This is a Unity bug, and can only be fixed by Unity themselves. If you do two of these things at the same time, 
the game can freeze:

<ul>
<li>Left clicking</li>
<li>Pressing enter</li>
<li>Pressing the spacebar</li>
</ul>

For example, if you left click and press enter at the same time, the game will freeze. You can mash left click, 
and the game won’t freeze. You can alternate between left clicking, and pressing the spacebar, and the game won’t freeze.
